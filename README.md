## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a python script that:
1. Converts a valid web URL into an image,
2. Automatically Describe the image using a caption, 
3. and coverts the caption into audio so that it could be read aloud and listened to. 

This project aims to assist visually impaired people in gaining a general overview of a website so that they can infer if the website is worth spending time on or not. It is generally known that it takes a long time for people with visual impairment to go through a webpage completely.

Appreciation to the [Public APIs Github Repository](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis.git) as all the APIs used in this project was first found there.
